gltf sandbox
============

(Built on python packages gltflib and pygltflib. I use the viewer at
https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ to verify the gltf/glb files.)

* gltflib_test.py

  - Creates single triangle with gltflib in test.gltf with vertex
    information in test_vertices.bin

* gltflib_test2.py

  - Creates single triangle with gltflib in test2.glb with vertex
    information stored as binary data inside the glb file

* gltflib_test4.py

  - Creates a cube with pygltflib in test4.glb with vertex information
    stored in test4.bin (I think test4.gltf doesn't work and/or there
    might still be something broken here.)

* gltflib_test5.py

  - Creates a green cube with pygltflib in test5.glb with vertex information
    stored in test5.bin (I think test5.gltf doesn't work and/or there
    might still be something broken here.)

* gltflib_test6.py

  - Creates a green and red cube with pygltflib in test6.glb with
    vertex information stored in test6.bin (I think test6.gltf doesn't
    work and/or there might still be something broken here.)

* gltflib_test7.py

  - Creates a green and textured cube with pygltflib in test7.glb with
    vertex information stored in test7.bin. The texture fails.
