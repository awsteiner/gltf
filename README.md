gltf sandbox
============

(Built on python packages gltflib and pygltflib. I use the viewer at
https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ to verify the gltf/glb files.)

* gltflib_test.py

  - Creates single triangle with gltflib in test.gltf with vertex
    information in test_vertices.bin

* gltflib_test2.py

  - Creates single triangle with gltflib in test2.glb with vertex
    information stored as binary data inside the glb file

* gltflib_test4.py

  - Creates a cube with pygltflib in test4.glb with vertex information
    stored in test4.bin (I think test4.gltf doesn't work and/or there
    might still be something broken here.)
